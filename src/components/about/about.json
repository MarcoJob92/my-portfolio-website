    "I have almost ever worked as a full-stack developer in all my work experiences, learning and using a braod range of different technologies.",
    "Altough I know many different languages (NodeJS and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure'>Clojure</a> to name a few), <b>Java</b> is my main programming language. <br/> I like to work with it and be part of a huge active comunity of developers that use this OOP language and its well known frameworks.",
    "But it's not all about OOP and Java. As a full-stack developer, I love to build dynamic UIs and that's why I like using modern front-end frameworks such as <b>React</b>. (Oh, by the way, this website was developed using React and JSX, keep reading to find out more)."
